# ZyXHtml Library Roadmap

## Current Functionality
The ZyXHtml library currently provides:
- Creation of HTML elements from template strings 
- Placeholders for dynamic data binding
- Reactive data binding for attributes and content
- Custom element registration with `this` reference
- Appending/prepending to DOM
- Joining with existing elements

## Potential Future Features

### Performance Optimizations
- Implement a virtual DOM for more efficient updates
- Lazy loading of elements not in viewport
- Asynchronous rendering of complex subtrees

### Templating Enhancements  
- Support for conditionals (if/else) in templates
- Looping constructs for rendering lists
- Ability to define reusable template partials
- Whitespace control options

### Reactivity Improvements
- Computed properties 
- Watchers for fine-grained reactivity control
- Reactive lifecycle hooks
- Batched updates for better performance

### Customization Options
- Ability to define custom template delimiters
- Pluggable template compilers
- Configurable attribute prefixes

### Integration with Other Libraries
- Provide adapters for popular state management libs like Redux
- Integration with routing libraries 
- Server-side rendering support
- Compatibility with Web Component specs

### Developer Experience
- Detailed documentation and examples
- Development mode with warnings for common mistakes
- Devtools integration for debugging
- TypeScript type definitions

## Roadmap Priorities
1. Performance optimizations (virtual DOM, lazy loading)
2. Templating enhancements (conditionals, loops, partials)
3. Reactivity improvements (computed props, watchers)
4. Library integrations (state management, routing, SSR) 
5. Customization options
6. DX improvements (docs, devmode, devtools)

The top priority should be performance, as this is critical for complex applications. Templating and reactivity improvements will also add significant value for developers. Integrations, customization, and DX can be phased in over time, but having a clear vision upfront is important.
